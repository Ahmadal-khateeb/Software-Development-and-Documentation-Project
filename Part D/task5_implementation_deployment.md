# Task 5: Implementation & Deployment

## Code Development
- The backend will be developed using **PHP**, following clean code principles and proper documentation (as instructed in the lectures).
- The frontend will be implemented using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript** to ensure a responsive and interactive user experience.
- AI features (such as smart search, product recommendations, and chat support) will be integrated using **TensorFlow.js** or relevant AI libraries.
- Code will follow a **modular architecture** to allow easier maintenance, debugging, and scalability in future updates.

## Build
- Prepare the project build by combining backend logic, frontend interface, and AI modules.
- Ensure compatibility and successful deployment across different environments (**development**, **testing**, and **production**).
- Set up configuration files for **environment variables**, **database connections**, and **third-party API integrations**.
- Compress and optimize assets (**images**, **CSS**, **JS**) to improve load time and performance.

## Unit Testing
- Develop unit tests for core backend functionalities, including **user authentication**, **product recommendation engine**, and **payment processing**.
- Use **PHPUnit** for backend (PHP) unit testing, and implement **mock data** for AI functions to validate logic independently.
- For the frontend, test critical UI components using JavaScript testing libraries such as **Jest** or **Mocha**.
- Each module should be tested independently before integration to catch early bugs.

## DevOps Integration
- Establish a **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)** pipeline using platforms like **GitHub Actions**, **GitLab CI**, or **Jenkins**.
- Automate **build**, **test**, and **deployment** processes to streamline workflow and reduce manual errors.
- **Containerize** the application using **Docker** for consistent deployment across environments.
- Monitor deployed environments using DevOps tools such as **Prometheus**, **New Relic**, or **LogRocket** to track performance and detect anomalies.
- Set up automated **notifications** for deployment success/failure and error logs.

This structured approach will ensure the project is well-implemented, tested, and deployed in a professional and efficient manner.
